# RESOURCE_ALLOCATION
#Overview
This project is a Python-based application that implements Dijkstra's algorithm with additional features for resource allocation. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, allowing users to input graph nodes, edges, and resource data to calculate the shortest paths and optimally distribute resources.

#Features
1.Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes in a graph.
2.Resource Allocation: Distributes resources like Medicine, Food, and Water to different nodes based on availability and demand.
3.Partial Delivery: When resources are insufficient, the system ensures that available resources are allocated optimally, with partial deliveries when necessary.
4.User-Friendly GUI: The application includes a simple and intuitive interface for easy input and visualization of nodes, edges, and resources.

#Usage
1.Input Number of Nodes: Specify the total number of nodes in your graph.
2.Set Start Node: Select the starting node for the shortest path calculation.
3.Input Resources: Enter the available quantities for Medicine, Food, and Water.
4.Add Node Demands: Define the resource demands for each node in the graph.
5.Define Edges: Input the edges between nodes, including weights (distances).
6.Run Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculate the shortest paths and view the distribution of resources based on availability and demand.
